When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to share my code with other people and also when it is necessary to keep backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's better to have complete control of what is happening in our local code base. Automatic pulls could lead to compilation errors and 
other unwanted changed to your development.
