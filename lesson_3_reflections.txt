When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to share my code with other people and also when it is necessary to keep backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's better to have complete control of what is happening in our local code base. Automatic pulls could lead to compilation errors and 
other unwanted changed to your development.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Take someone else's code and create a copy in your own account and then modify it.
Clone - Directly copy over code and history information from a local or remote repo into one's computer.
Branch - Create a seperate line of commits in the same repo other than a master for example.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a local copy enables us to work offline when we need to merge various changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without git or github it would be hard to do this as I would have to always mail my code and then the other collaborator would 
have to do a comparism between all the files before making another changes.
Basically it would be insane to track all the changes taking place.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes in the separate branch makes sure than the original master branch in one's local machine does not get messed up.
We can easily push the diff branch into github and then create pull requests which allow other to verfiy our changes before modifying the 
master branch.
